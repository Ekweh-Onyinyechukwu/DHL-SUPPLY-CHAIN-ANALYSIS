### KPI RECOMMENDATIONS:
This means that the company is making a very good profit on its products. The profit margin is over 90%, which is very high.

The average selling price per product is relatively low, which suggests that the company is targeting the budget-friendly market. The inventory turnover ratio is very high, which means that the company is selling its inventory very quickly.

Overall, the data suggests that the company is performing very well. It is making a good profit, its products are selling well, and its inventory turnover ratio is high.

Here are some additional insights:

The company could consider increasing its prices slightly, as its profit margin is already very high. This would allow the company to generate even more revenue.

The company should continue to monitor its inventory levels and ensure that it has enough products in stock to meet demand.

The company could also consider expanding its product line to include new and different types of products. This would allow the company to reach a wider range of customers and increase its sales.
